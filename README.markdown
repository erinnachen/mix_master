# Mix Master

This Rails app was built during the weekend of the third week of Module 2 at the Turing School. The tutorial that we followed can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master).

This app is deployed on Heroku [here](https://stark-waters-69677.herokuapp.com/).
